This is a micro display made out of IC2 OLED display which is connected to your phone via Bluetooth and sends out all notifications (notification in your notification bar ) to this display. Yes this is same concept as like smart watch but you can customize for all app to mirror their notifications to this micro display, build your own compartment as end product so that you can hook it up with your bike keys or or wrap it up in your wrist (i didn't have enough time or resource for now so its totally up to you).
